### Description

Spice up your Feather project with a beautiful 3.5" touchscreen display shield with built in microSD card socket. This TFT display is 3.5" diagonal with a bright 6 white-LED backlight. You get a massive 480x320 pixels with individual 16-bit color pixel control. It has way more resolution than a black and white 128x64 display, and twice as much as our 2.4" TFT FeatherWing. As a bonus, this display comes with a resistive touchscreen attached to it already, so you can detect finger presses anywhere on the screen

This FeatherWing uses a SPI display, touchscreen and SD card socket. It works with any and all Feathers but given the large display it works best with our faster boards like the nRF52, ESP8266, ESP32, M0, M4, WICED, and Teensy. We also include an SPI resistive touchscreen controller so you only need one additional pin to add a high quality touchscreen controller. One more pin is used for an optional SD card that can be used for storing images for display.

This Wing comes fully assembled with dual sockets for your Feather to plug into. You get two sockets per pin so you can plug in wires if you want to connect to Feather pins. Alternatively, each pin has a large square pad on the PCB for direct soldering.
